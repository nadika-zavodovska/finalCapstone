          <h1>Badminton</h1>
        <p>
          Badminton is a racket sport played by either two opposing players
          (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on
          opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net.
          Players score points by striking a shuttlecock with their racket so
          that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents' half of the
          court. A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the ground, and
          the shuttlecock may only be struck once by each side before it passes
          over the net.

        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>
          You can play badminton in both indoor or outdoor environments,
          however, most of the world-class competitions are held in an indoor
          area because they want to reduce the influence caused by external
          factors such as wind and lights to the minimum level.

            Badminton could be traced back to more than 2000 years ago to the
            ancient game called battledore (bat or paddle) and shuttlecock (also
            called "bird" or "birdie"), similar games were played for centuries
            across Eurasia countries such as Greece, Egypt, China, India, and
            Japan. From the 1600s, battledore and shuttlecock was just a game
            involving 2 persons hitting a shuttlecock towards each other as many
            times as possible before it hit the ground and it used to be an
            upper-class game in Europe, including England. Nowadays, You can
            still find a similar game in Japan which is called Hanetsuki, it's a
            very popular new year's game involving a wooden paddle called
            hagoita and a shuttle called hane.

          <h3>Development of Badminton</h3>
          <p>
            According to "A Brief History of Badminton from 1870 to 1949"
            written by Betty Uber, modern badminton was created by British
            military officers by around 1850s in British India, at that time, a
            net was added to the game and because it was very popular in the
            garrison town of Poona, the game was known as Poona. During that
            period, when the weather is windy and wet, instead of a shuttlecock,
            a woolen ball was preferred by the upper class and hence invented
            "Ball badminton". By around 1870s, Retired British army officers
            brought the game back to England from India and it became a very
            popular sport. In 1873 the Duke of Beaufort introduced the sport at
            his country estate, "Badminton House" in Gloucestershire, since then
            this sport was called Badminton.

          In 1875, a badminton club in Folkestone, England was started by
          retired officers from British India. In 1887, J. H. E. Hart of the
          Bath Badminton Club standardized the rules. On 13 September 1893, the
          Badminton Association of England published the first set of rules
          similar to the modern rules that were published in a house called
          "Dunbar" at Six Waverley Grove, Portsmouth, England. By 1899, they
          started the first badminton competition in the world, "All England
          Open Badminton Championships". By 1934, the International Badminton
          Federation (IBF, now known as the Badminton World Federation) was
          formed with England, Scotland, Wales, Canada, Denmark, France,
          Ireland, New Zealand, and the Netherlands as the founding members. By
          1948, the International Badminton Federation launched the first
          tournament: Thomas Cup (World Men's Team Championships). Since then,
          more world-class events have been launched such as: Uber Club (World
          Team Championships for Women) World Championships (BWF World
          Championships) Sudirman Cup (Mixed Team Badminton Championship takes
          place every 2 years) World Junior Championships (BWF World Junior
          Championships) World Grand Prix Finals (BWF World Badminton Grand Prix
          Finals, only the top 8 players in the year-end world rankings were
          invited) By 1972, Badminton became a demo sport at the Munich Olympics
          and became an official Olympic Sport at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
          At that time, only singles and doubles were listed. By 1996, Mixed
          Doubles was included in the Atlanta Olympic Games, til now, Badminton
          is still the only sport with mixed doubles events in the Olympics.
          These countries have won the gold medals at the Olympics since 1992 to
          2020: Indonesia, Denmark, China, South Korea, Japan, and Spain.

        <h3>Why is badminton called badminton?</h3>
        <p>
          Badminton was called badminton because it was officially introduced to

          of Beaufort in Gloucestershire by 1873. Since then, Badminton was
          named "Badminton" instead of "Poona" and "Battledore and Shuttlecock".
